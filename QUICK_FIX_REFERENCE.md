## 🚀 Quick Deployment

### Option 1: Deploy Now (Recommended)
```bash
# Build and deploy
npm run build
pm2 restart jobportal

# Re-import jobs with correct IDs
curl -X POST https://naukrimili.com/api/jobs/import-multi-country \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"countries":["IN","US","UK","AE"],"maxJobsPerCountry":200}'
```

### Option 2: Test Locally First
```bash
# Run development server
npm run dev

# Test these URLs:
http://localhost:3000/companies/[any-company-id]
http://localhost:3000/dashboard/jobseeker/applications
http://localhost:3000/jobs

# Click "View Details" on any job - should work!
```

---

## 🗃️ Database Cleanup (Optional)

If you have existing jobs with decimal IDs:

```sql
-- Check for invalid jobs
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "Job" WHERE "sourceId" ~ '\d+\.\d+';

-- Delete invalid jobs (safe - only those without applications)
DELETE FROM "Job" 
WHERE "sourceId" ~ '\d+\.\d+' 
AND "applicationsCount" = 0;
```

**Script:** `scripts/cleanup-invalid-job-ids.sql`

4. Check database has job with that sourceId
```

### Mobile Display Issues
```
1. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check viewport meta tag in layout
4. Verify Tailwind classes are correct
