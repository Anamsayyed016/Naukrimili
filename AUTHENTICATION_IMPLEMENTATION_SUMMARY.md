# 🔐 Authentication & User Management Implementation Summary

## ✅ **COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION**

### **1. Font Visibility Issues - FIXED!**
- **Problem**: User dropdown menu text was invisible (white on white)
- **Solution**: Added explicit text colors and background styling to all dropdown menu items
- **Files Updated**: `components/MainNavigation.tsx`

### **2. Real Authentication System - IMPLEMENTED!**
- **Context Provider**: `context/AuthContext.tsx` - Manages user state globally
- **Layout Integration**: `app/layout.tsx` - Wraps entire app with AuthProvider
- **Navigation Updates**: `components/MainNavigation.tsx` - Shows user info when logged in

### **3. User Registration Forms - SEPARATED & ENHANCED!**
- **Job Seeker Form**: `/auth/register/jobseeker` - Professional-focused registration
- **Employer Form**: `/auth/register/employer` - Company-focused registration
- **Main Registration**: `/auth/register` - Landing page to choose account type

### **4. API Endpoints - CREATED!**
- **Job Seeker Registration**: `/api/auth/register/jobseeker`
- **Employer Registration**: `/api/auth/register/employer`
- **Login**: `/api/auth/login` (existing, enhanced)
- **Logout**: `/api/auth/logout` (new)

### **5. User Profile Page - CREATED!**
- **Route**: `/profile` - Shows user details when logged in
- **Role-Based Content**: Different actions for job seekers vs employers
- **Authentication Protection**: Redirects to login if not authenticated

## 🏗️ **ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW**

### **Authentication Flow**
```
1. User visits site → Shows Sign In/Sign Up buttons
2. User registers → Creates account → Automatically logged in
3. User logs in → Stored in AuthContext → Navigation shows user menu
4. User logs out → Clears AuthContext → Returns to public state
```

### **User State Management**
- **AuthContext**: Central state for user authentication
- **Local Storage**: Persists user session across page refreshes
- **Role-Based Routing**: Different dashboards for different user types

### **Component Structure**
```
MainNavigation
├── Public State: Sign In/Sign Up buttons
└── Authenticated State: User dropdown with profile info
    ├── User avatar with initials
    ├── User details (name, email, role)
    ├── Menu items (Profile, Settings, etc.)
    └── Logout button
```
