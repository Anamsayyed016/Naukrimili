const data = await response.json();
```

const response = await fetch('/api/jobs/search?what=developer&salary_min=50000&salary_max=100000');
```

## Component Usage

### Enhanced Job Search Component
The main job search interface is available as `<EnhancedJobSearch />`:

```tsx
import EnhancedJobSearch from '../components/EnhancedJobSearch';

export default function JobsPage() {
  return (
    <EnhancedJobSearch 
      initialQuery="developer"
      initialLocation="san francisco"
    />
  );
}
```

### Job Search Widget
For simpler search forms, use `<JobSearchWidget />`:

```tsx
import JobSearchWidget from '../components/JobSearchWidget';

export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <JobSearchWidget 
      location="New York"
      onSearch={(params) => {
        console.log('Search params:', params);
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

## Rate Limits

## Error Handling

The integration includes comprehensive error handling:
- API credential validation
- Network error handling  
- Graceful fallbacks for missing data
- User-friendly error messages

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Adzuna API credentials are not configured" error**
   - Make sure `ADZUNA_APP_ID` and `ADZUNA_API_KEY` are set in your environment files
   - Restart your development server after adding credentials

2. **No jobs returned**
   - Check if your search terms are too specific
   - Verify the country code in your API configuration
   - Check API rate limits

3. **CORS errors**
   - API calls should go through your Next.js API routes, not directly to Adzuna

### Testing Your Setup

1. Add your API credentials
2. Restart your development server: `npm run dev`
3. Navigate to `/jobs`
4. Try searching for "developer" jobs
5. Check the browser console for any errors
