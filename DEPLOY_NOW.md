# 🚀 DEPLOY NOW - Quick Action Guide

## ✅ **ALL ISSUES FIXED**

Your deployment was failing because **`set -e` was exiting the script immediately** when checking for PM2.

**THE FIX:** Temporarily disable `set -e` when checking conditions, capture the result, then re-enable.

- **Status**: `ssh user@server "pm2 status"`
- **Logs**: `ssh user@server "pm2 logs jobportal"`

## 🎯 **The Critical Fix**

**Problem:**
```bash
set -e  # Exit on any error
if ! command -v pm2; then  # Exits here when PM2 not found!
    install_pm2  # Never reaches this
fi
```

**Solution:**
```bash
set +e  # Temporarily disable
command -v pm2
PM2_EXISTS=$?  # Capture result
set -e  # Re-enable

if [ $PM2_EXISTS -ne 0 ]; then
    install_pm2  # Now this runs!
fi
```
