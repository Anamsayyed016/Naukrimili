## Testing Guide

1. **Navigate to dashboard**: Go to `/dashboard` (for job seekers)

2. **Search for non-existent job**: Enter something like "unicorn trainer in antarctica"
3. **Verify fallback options**: Should see both Google Jobs and Naukri.com search options
4. **Test both buttons**: 
   - Google Jobs should open Google's job search

NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### For Resume Upload to work:
- Ensure NextAuth session is working

- Maximum file size: 5MB
