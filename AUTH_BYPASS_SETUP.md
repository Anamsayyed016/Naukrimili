# ðŸ”“ Authentication Bypass System Setup

## Quick Setup Instructions

### 1. Enable Authentication Bypass

Add this to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
AUTH_DISABLED=true
```

Or for public environment variable:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_AUTH=true
```

### 2. How It Works

When authentication is disabled:

1. **Get Started Button** â†’ Redirects to `/auth/bypass` instead of `/auth/signin`
2. **User enters email** â†’ Validates email format
3. **User selects role** â†’ Jobseeker or Employer
4. **System saves to database** â†’ Real user record with locked role
5. **Redirects to dashboard** â†’ Full functionality with real data

### 3. User Flow

```
Homepage â†’ Get Started â†’ Enter Email â†’ Choose Role â†’ Dashboard
    â†“           â†“            â†“           â†“           â†“
  No Auth   Bypass Page   Validation  Database   Full Access
```

### 4. Database Integration

- **Real user records** created in PostgreSQL
- **Email uniqueness** enforced
- **Role locking** prevents changes
- **Full compatibility** with existing authentication

### 5. Rollback Instructions

To restore normal authentication:

1. Remove or set to `false`:
   ```bash
   AUTH_DISABLED=false
   NEXT_PUBLIC_DISABLE_AUTH=false
   ```

2. Restart the application
3. All authentication flows return to normal

### 6. Features Preserved

âœ… **All dashboards work** - Jobseeker, Employer, Admin  
âœ… **Real database operations** - No mock data  
âœ… **Role-based permissions** - Full access control  
âœ… **UI/UX consistency** - No visual changes  
âœ… **Email validation** - Prevents duplicates  
âœ… **Role locking** - Permanent role assignment  

### 7. Security Notes

- Users created via bypass are real database users
- Roles are permanently locked to prevent changes
- All existing security measures remain intact
- No authentication data is stored in browser

### 8. Testing

1. Set `AUTH_DISABLED=true` in `.env.local`
2. Restart the development server
3. Click "Get Started" on homepage
4. Enter any valid email
5. Select a role
6. Verify you're redirected to the appropriate dashboard
7. Confirm all features work normally

The system is now ready for use with authentication bypass enabled!
