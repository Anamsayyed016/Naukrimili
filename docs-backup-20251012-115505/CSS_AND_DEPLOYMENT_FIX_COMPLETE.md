# CSS Loading & Deployment Fix - Complete Summary

## Date: October 10, 2025

## Problems Identified

### 1. CSS Loading Issue
- **Symptom**: `Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token` in browser console for CSS files
- **Root Cause**: CSS files were being loaded as both `<link>` tags (correct) and `<script>` tags (incorrect)
- **Technical Cause**: Webpack configuration in `next.config.mjs` was interfering with Next.js's natural CSS handling

### 2. Deployment Failure
- **Symptom**: `.next` directory not found on server after deployment
- **Root Cause**: 
  - SCP action was creating empty tar archives
  - Build artifacts weren't being transferred correctly
  - Workflow was using generic `source: .` which wasn't working properly

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed `next.config.mjs`
**File**: `next.config.mjs`

**Changes Made**:
- ‚úÖ Removed problematic `webpack` configuration that was interfering with CSS handling
- ‚úÖ Removed `experimental.optimizeCss` feature that was causing CSS to load as scripts
- ‚úÖ Removed `compiler.removeConsole` optimization
- ‚úÖ Kept essential features:
  - Cache busting headers
  - Proper MIME type for CSS files (`text/css; charset=utf-8`)
  - Security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options)
  - Image optimization

**Result**: Next.js now handles CSS naturally without webpack interference.

### 2. Fixed GitHub Actions Workflow
**File**: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

**Changes Made**:

#### A. Added Pre-Transfer Verification (Line 304-341)
```yaml
- name: üîç Pre-transfer verification
  run: |
    # Verify .next directory exists and has content
    # Count files to ensure build is not empty
    # List key build artifacts
```

**Purpose**: Ensures build artifacts exist before attempting transfer.

#### B. Fixed SCP Source Configuration (Line 369-407)
**Before**:
```yaml
source: |
  .
  !.git
  !node_modules
  # ... exclusions
```

**After**:
```yaml
source: ".next/,public/,app/,components/,lib/,styles/,prisma/,package.json,package-lock.json,next.config.mjs,server.cjs,ecosystem.config.cjs,tsconfig.json,postcss.config.cjs,tailwind.config.cjs,.env"
```

**Purpose**: Explicitly lists all required files and directories, ensuring `.next` is included.

#### C. Updated Server File Handling (Line 95-123)
**Before**: Workflow created `server.cjs`, `ecosystem.config.cjs`, etc. from scratch
**After**: Workflow verifies these files exist in repository and uses them directly

**Purpose**: Prevents workflow from overwriting fixed configuration files.

### 3. Synced Dependencies
**File**: `package-lock.json`

**Changes Made**:
- ‚úÖ Ran `npm install --package-lock-only` to sync with `package.json`
- ‚úÖ Resolved version mismatches:
  - `@types/node`: 20.19.19 ‚Üí 20.19.20
  - `@types/react`: 18.3.25 ‚Üí 18.3.26
  - `tailwindcss`: 3.4.18 ‚Üí 4.1.14

**Result**: `npm ci` will now work correctly in CI/CD without falling back to `npm install`.

## Commits Made

1. **9c72c96c**: "Fix CSS loading issue: Remove webpack interference in next.config.mjs"
2. **36e3bef6**: "Sync package-lock.json with package.json"
3. **b0f64ebe**: "Fix deployment: Add pre-transfer verification and explicit file list for SCP"

## Expected Results

### After Deployment Completes:

1. ‚úÖ **CSS Files Load Correctly**
   - CSS will be loaded only as `<link rel="stylesheet">` tags
   - No more `<script>` tags for CSS files
   - No more `SyntaxError` in browser console

2. ‚úÖ **Styling Applies Properly**
   - All Tailwind CSS classes will work
   - Custom styles will be applied
   - Mobile and desktop views will render correctly

3. ‚úÖ **Build Artifacts Transfer Successfully**
   - `.next` directory will be present on server
   - `.next/server` directory will be present
   - `.next/static` directory will be present with all CSS and JS files

4. ‚úÖ **PM2 Starts Successfully**
   - Server will start without "beforeFiles" errors
   - Application will be accessible at https://naukrimili.com
   - No more missing build artifact errors

## Monitoring the Deployment

### Check GitHub Actions:
```
https://github.com/Anamsayyed016/Naukrimili/actions
```

### Expected Workflow Steps:
1. ‚úÖ Install dependencies (with synced package-lock.json)
2. ‚úÖ Build application
3. ‚úÖ Pre-transfer verification (NEW - verifies .next exists)
4. ‚úÖ Copy files to server (with explicit file list)
5. ‚úÖ Deploy to Hostinger VPS
6. ‚úÖ Start PM2

### After Deployment:
1. Open browser to: `https://naukrimili.com`
2. Open DevTools Console (F12)
3. Check for:
   - ‚úÖ No `SyntaxError` for CSS files
   - ‚úÖ All CSS files load with status 200
   - ‚úÖ Styling is applied correctly

## Technical Details

### Why CSS Was Loading as Script Tags:

The `webpack` configuration in `next.config.mjs` was using custom `splitChunks` settings:

```javascript
config.optimization.splitChunks = {
  chunks: 'all',
  cacheGroups: {
    vendor: {
      test: /[\\/]node_modules[\\/]/,
      name: 'vendors',
      // ...
    },
  },
};
```

This interfered with Next.js's internal CSS handling, causing the build to:
1. Generate CSS files correctly in `.next/static/css/`
2. But also include them in JavaScript chunks
3. Which resulted in HTML injecting both `<link>` and `<script>` tags for the same CSS file

### Why Deployment Was Failing:

The SCP action with `source: .` was:
1. Creating a tar archive of the entire directory
2. But the tar command was producing an empty archive
3. This resulted in no files being transferred to the server
4. The server then had no `.next` directory to run

By explicitly listing files, we ensure:
1. Only required files are included
2. The tar archive is not empty
3. All build artifacts are transferred
4. The server has everything it needs to run

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If the deployment fails, you can rollback:

```bash
# On server
cd /var/www/naukrimili
git checkout 9c72c96c^  # Go back one commit before fixes
npm ci
npm run build
pm2 restart naukrimili
```

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor the current deployment** (in progress)
2. **Verify CSS loads correctly** in browser
3. **Test all pages** to ensure styling is applied
4. **Check mobile responsiveness**
5. **Monitor PM2 logs** for any errors

## Files Modified

1. `next.config.mjs` - Removed webpack interference
2. `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Fixed artifact transfer
3. `package-lock.json` - Synced with package.json

## Files Created (Previously)

1. `styles/clean-globals.css` - Optimized global styles (ready for use)
2. `styles/clean-mobile-notifications.css` - Optimized mobile notifications (ready for use)
3. `styles/clean-mobile-job-form.css` - Optimized mobile job form (ready for use)
4. `css-rebuild-instructions.md` - Deployment instructions for clean CSS
5. `scripts/css-rebuild-deploy.sh` - Automated deployment script for clean CSS

**Note**: The clean CSS files are available if you want to replace the existing ones later, but the current fix should resolve the loading issue without needing to replace the CSS files.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow completes successfully
- [ ] `.next` directory is present on server
- [ ] PM2 starts without errors
- [ ] Website loads at https://naukrimili.com
- [ ] No `SyntaxError` in browser console
- [ ] All styling is applied correctly
- [ ] Mobile view works properly

## Estimated Completion Time

- Deployment: ~10-15 minutes
- Total time from push to live: ~15-20 minutes

## Contact

If you encounter any issues after deployment:
1. Check GitHub Actions logs
2. SSH to server and check PM2 logs: `pm2 logs naukrimili`
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify `.next` directory exists on server: `ls -la /var/www/naukrimili/.next`
