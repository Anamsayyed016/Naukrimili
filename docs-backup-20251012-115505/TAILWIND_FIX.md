# 🎨 TailwindCSS Fix Applied

## ❌ **Issue Fixed**
```
Error: Cannot find module 'tailwindcss'
This typically means that Tailwind CSS is referenced in your code but is not installed as a dependency.
```

## ✅ **Solution Applied**

### **1. Fixed Dependency Installation**
- **Before**: TailwindCSS installed as `--save-dev` (dev dependency)
- **After**: TailwindCSS installed as regular dependency

### **2. Added TailwindCSS Verification**
- **Added**: Verification step to check if TailwindCSS is properly installed
- **Added**: Fallback installation if TailwindCSS is missing
- **Added**: Both CI and server-side verification

### **3. Ensured Config Files**
- **Added**: TailwindCSS config creation during deployment
- **Added**: PostCSS config creation during deployment
- **Verified**: Existing config files are properly configured

## 🔧 **Changes Made**

### **GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)**

#### **CI Side:**
```bash
# Install TailwindCSS as regular dependency
npm install --legacy-peer-deps --engine-strict=false \
  tailwindcss@3.4.18 \
  postcss@8.4.47 \
  autoprefixer@10.4.20

# Create TailwindCSS config if missing
if [ ! -f "tailwind.config.js" ]; then
  npx tailwindcss init -p
fi

# Verify TailwindCSS installation
if ! node -e "require('tailwindcss')" > /dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "❌ TailwindCSS not found, installing..."
  npm install --legacy-peer-deps --engine-strict=false tailwindcss@3.4.18
else
  echo "✅ TailwindCSS is properly installed"
fi
```

#### **Server Side:**
```bash
# Same fixes applied to server-side deployment
# Ensures TailwindCSS is available during build
```
