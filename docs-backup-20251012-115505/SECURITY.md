# Security Policy

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Job Portal application and provides guidelines for maintaining security standards.

## Security Features

### 1. Authentication & Authorization

- **NextAuth.js Integration**: Secure authentication with JWT tokens
- **Password Security**: 
  - Minimum 8 characters with complexity requirements
  - bcrypt hashing with salt rounds of 12
  - Rate limiting on authentication attempts (5 attempts per 15 minutes)
- **Session Management**: 
  - JWT tokens with 24-hour expiration
  - Secure session cookies with httpOnly and secure flags
  - Automatic token refresh

### 2. Input Validation & Sanitization

- **Zod Schema Validation**: Type-safe input validation on all API endpoints
- **HTML Sanitization**: DOMPurify integration to prevent XSS attacks
- **File Upload Security**:
  - File type validation (PDF, DOC, DOCX only)
  - File size limits (5MB maximum)
  - Virus scanning simulation
  - Filename sanitization

### 3. API Security

- **Rate Limiting**: 100 requests per minute per IP address
- **CSRF Protection**: Token-based CSRF protection for state-changing operations
- **CORS Configuration**: Restricted origins and proper headers
- **Error Handling**: Sanitized error messages in production

### 4. Security Headers

- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- `Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()`
- `Strict-Transport-Security` (production only)

### 5. Database Security

- **Connection Security**: Encrypted connections with proper authentication
- **Query Protection**: Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- **Data Validation**: Schema-level validation with Mongoose
- **Connection Pooling**: Optimized connection management

### 6. Environment Security

- **Environment Validation**: Required environment variables validation
- **Secret Management**: Secure handling of API keys and secrets
- **Development vs Production**: Different security levels based on environment

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Never commit secrets**: Use `.env` files and add them to `.gitignore`
2. **Validate all inputs**: Use Zod schemas for all user inputs
3. **Sanitize outputs**: Always sanitize data before rendering
4. **Use HTTPS**: Ensure all communications are encrypted
5. **Regular updates**: Keep dependencies updated and audit regularly

### For Deployment

1. **Environment Variables**: Set all required environment variables
2. **HTTPS Configuration**: Configure SSL/TLS certificates
3. **Database Security**: Use encrypted connections and strong passwords
4. **Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring for security events
5. **Backup Strategy**: Regular encrypted backups

## Security Checklist

### Pre-deployment

- [ ] All environment variables configured
- [ ] HTTPS enabled
- [ ] Database connections encrypted
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] Rate limiting enabled
- [ ] Error handling sanitized
- [ ] File upload restrictions in place
- [ ] Authentication flow tested
- [ ] CSRF protection enabled
- [ ] Input validation comprehensive

### Regular Maintenance

- [ ] Dependencies updated monthly
- [ ] Security audit performed quarterly
- [ ] Logs reviewed weekly
- [ ] Backup integrity tested monthly
- [ ] Access controls reviewed quarterly

## Vulnerability Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **Do not** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email security concerns to: [security@yourcompany.com]
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow reasonable time for response and fix

## Security Monitoring

### Logging

The application logs the following security events:

- Authentication attempts (success/failure)
- Rate limit violations
- File upload attempts
- API errors and exceptions
- Database connection issues

### Alerts

Set up monitoring for:

- Multiple failed authentication attempts
- Unusual API usage patterns
- File upload anomalies
- Database connection failures
- High error rates

## Compliance

This application implements security measures to comply with:

- **OWASP Top 10**: Protection against common web vulnerabilities
- **GDPR**: Data protection and privacy requirements
- **SOC 2**: Security and availability controls

## Security Tools

### Development

- **ESLint Security Plugin**: Static code analysis for security issues
- **npm audit**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **TypeScript**: Type safety to prevent runtime errors

### Production

- **Rate Limiting**: Express rate limit middleware
- **Helmet.js**: Security headers middleware
- **bcrypt**: Password hashing
- **DOMPurify**: XSS protection

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Preserve evidence
   - Notify stakeholders

2. **Investigation**:
   - Analyze logs and evidence
   - Determine scope and impact
   - Identify root cause

3. **Recovery**:
   - Implement fixes
   - Restore services
   - Monitor for recurrence

4. **Post-Incident**:
   - Document lessons learned
   - Update security measures
   - Conduct security review
