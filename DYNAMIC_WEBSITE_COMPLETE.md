## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### For Hostinger Deployment:

1. **Upload Files**:
   ```bash
   # Upload contents of hostinger-deploy/ to your public_html folder
   ```

2. **Configure Environment**:
   - Update `.env.production` with your actual API keys
   - Set your domain URL in `NEXTAUTH_URL`
   - Configure any database connections

3. **Start Application**:
   ```bash
   # SSH into your server
   chmod +x start.sh
   ./start.sh
   ```

4. **Verify Deployment**:
   - Visit: `https://your-domain.com`
   - Check health: `https://your-domain.com/api/health`
   - Monitor: `https://your-domain.com/diagnostic`

### Alternative cPanel Method:
1. Upload files via File Manager
2. Set up Node.js app in cPanel
3. Point to `server.js` as startup file
4. Configure environment variables

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `app/api/health/route.ts` - Server health monitoring
- `app/diagnostic/page.tsx` - System diagnostics page
- `server.js` - Custom server for deployment
- `middleware.ts` - Security and CORS middleware
- `.env.production` - Production environment config
- `deploy-hostinger.js` - Deployment automation script
- `hostinger-deploy/` - Complete deployment package

### Modified Files:
- `app/page.tsx` - Made dynamic with real data fetching
- `package.json` - Added deployment scripts
- `.github/workflows/hostinger-deploy.yml` - Updated deployment workflow

## 🔍 Key Features Added

### Dynamic Data Loading:
```typescript
// Homepage now fetches real data
const [featuredJobs, setFeaturedJobs] = useState<Job[]>([]);
const [topCompanies, setTopCompanies] = useState<Company[]>([]);

useEffect(() => {
  // Fetch jobs and companies from APIs
  fetchData();
}, []);
```

### Health Monitoring:
```typescript
// Health check endpoint
GET /api/health
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "uptime": "45 minutes",
  "apis": { "jobs": true, "companies": true },
  "memory": { "used": "125 MB", "total": "512 MB" }
}
```

### Server Diagnostics:
- Real-time API testing
- Memory usage monitoring
- Environment status
- Database connectivity checks

## 🎯 Benefits Achieved

1. **Dynamic Content**: Website now shows real, up-to-date information
2. **Server Monitoring**: Can identify and debug server issues quickly
3. **Production Ready**: Optimized for Hostinger deployment
4. **Scalable Architecture**: Built for growth and expansion
5. **Professional UX**: Loading states and error handling
6. **SEO Friendly**: Server-side rendering capabilities
7. **Performance Optimized**: Efficient data fetching and caching

## 🔧 Server-Side Issue Resolution

The implementation addresses common server-side issues:
