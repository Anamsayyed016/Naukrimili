## Color Palette

### Current Colors
- Primary Background: Yellow (#ffff00)
- Secondary/Accent: Light Yellow (#ffff80)

### Proposed Colors
- Primary: Navy Blue (#2c3e50)
  - A classic, professional color that conveys trust, reliability, and confidence
  - Appropriate for corporate and professional settings
  - High contrast with white background for excellent readability

- Secondary: Slate Gray (#f0f4f8)
  - Subtle, muted background for content sections
  - Professional appearance without being distracting
  - Maintains high contrast with dark text

- Accent: Light Gray (#e2e8f0)
  - Used for skill tags and secondary elements
  - Provides visual distinction without being overpowering
  - Maintains a cohesive, professional look

## Design Rationale

### Professional Appearance
The navy blue and slate gray color scheme projects professionalism and competence, which is crucial for job applications. These colors are widely used in corporate environments and are associated with stability and trustworthiness.

### ATS Compatibility
The new design maintains 100% ATS compatibility by:
- Using standard, readable fonts with black/dark gray text on light backgrounds
- Avoiding complex design elements that could confuse parsing algorithms
- Maintaining clear section headers and content organization
- Preserving the original structure and information hierarchy

### Improved Readability
The new color scheme offers better readability through:
- Higher contrast between text and backgrounds
- More subdued background colors that don't compete with the content
- Consistent visual hierarchy that guides the eye through important information
- WCAG-compliant color contrast ratios for accessibility

### Visual Hierarchy
The redesign enhances visual hierarchy by:
- Using color to subtly differentiate between sections
- Applying consistent styling to related elements (skills, experience items)
- Maintaining clear section headers with distinctive styling
- Creating a natural flow through the document

## Implementation Notes

### CSS Changes
The implementation will require updates to the following CSS variables and classes:

```css
/* In globals.css or relevant component styles */
/* Replace yellow backgrounds with new color scheme */
.ats-score-card {
  background-color: #f0f4f8;
  border: 1px solid #2c3e50;
  color: #2c3e50;
}

.skill-tag {
  background-color: #e2e8f0;
  color: #2c3e50;
}

.experience-item {
  background-color: #f0f4f8;
  color: #2c3e50;
}

/* Update section headers */
.section-header {
  color: #2c3e50;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

### Component Updates
The primary components requiring updates are:
- ResumeUploadModal.tsx
- Any resume display components in the jobseeker dashboard

## Benefits

1. **Enhanced Professionalism**: The new color scheme immediately elevates the perceived professionalism of the resume display.

2. **Improved Focus on Content**: By using more subdued background colors, the actual resume content becomes the focus rather than the design elements.

3. **Better Accessibility**: The new color scheme provides better contrast ratios, making the content more accessible to all users.

4. **Consistent Branding**: The navy and slate colors can be consistently applied across the platform for a cohesive look.

5. **Maintained ATS Compatibility**: All changes preserve or enhance the resume's ability to be properly parsed by Applicant Tracking Systems.

## Conclusion

The proposed color scheme redesign transforms the resume display from its current yellow-based design to a more professional, modern aesthetic using navy blue and slate gray. This change maintains full ATS compatibility while significantly improving the visual appeal and readability of the resume display.
