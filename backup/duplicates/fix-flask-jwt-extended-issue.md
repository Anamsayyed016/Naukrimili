# Fix for Flask-JWT-Extended Import Issue

## Problem Identified
- The import `from flask_jwt_extended import JWTManager, create_access_token, jwt_required, get_jwt_identity` in `backend/app.py` is failing because Pylance cannot resolve the package.
- The `requirements.txt` file appears to be corrupted or empty.

## Solution

### 1. Fix the requirements.txt file
The project already has an `environment.yml` file with all the necessary dependencies. We need to create a proper `requirements.txt` file based on these dependencies:

```
flask==3.0.2
flask-cors==4.0.0
flask-jwt-extended==4.6.0
flask-restful>=0.3.10
pymongo==4.6.2
python-dotenv==1.0.1
bson==0.5.10
PyPDF2>=3.0.0
python-docx>=0.8.11
PyMuPDF>=1.22.3
pytesseract>=0.3.10
imagehash>=4.3.1
python-magic>=0.4.27
python-magic-bin>=0.4.14
```

### 2. Install the missing dependencies
Run the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Verify the app.py file
The `app.py` file itself doesn't have any issues with the import statement. Once the package is installed, Pylance should be able to resolve the import.

## Additional Notes
- The JWT setup in `app.py` is incomplete. The file imports JWT-related functions but doesn't initialize the JWTManager with the Flask app.
- Consider adding the following code after the Flask app initialization:

```python
# JWT Configuration
app.config['JWT_SECRET_KEY'] = os.getenv('JWT_SECRET_KEY', 'your-secret-key')
jwt = JWTManager(app)
```

## Implementation Steps
1. Switch to Code mode to implement these changes
2. Create/update the requirements.txt file
3. Install the dependencies
4. Add the JWT configuration to app.py if needed
